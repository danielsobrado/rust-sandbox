struct Solution;

// Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the 
// largest sum and return its sum.
// A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

// Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm can be viewed both as a greedy and Dynamic Programming problem. 
// As we can see that we are keeping a running sum of integers and when it becomes less than 0, we reset it to 0 (Greedy Part). 
// This is because continuing with a negative sum is way more worse than restarting with a new range. 
// Now it can also be viewed as a Dynamic Programming problem, at each stage we have 2 choices: 
// Either take the current element and continue with previous sum OR restart a new range. 
// These both choices are being taken care of in the implementation. 

// Time Complexity: O(n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)
